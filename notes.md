They can be included with teh main line of your project
the main branch - the one where all the changes eventually get merged back into and is called master
when you creat a repository you are creating automatically a master branch
if you create a new branch it will be an exact replic of the mater branch

make a commit
record changes to one or more files in your branch
git assign each commit a unique ID, called a SHA or hash taht identifies the specifc changes
open and merge pull request
Notifies developers about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository
Acknowledge and review changes
you can create a pull request on GitHub in 2 ways
1. pull requst from a repositoy
2.pull rquest from a branch within a repository
git init // initialize local git reporsitoy 
git add file add file to index
git status  what you have in staging area or check status of working tree
git commit  commit changes to index
git push // push it to remote repository such as git hub or anorher remote service
git pull  //pul latest changes from remote repo (if someone makes a change and you want the latest version)
git clone   //clone repository into a new directory
